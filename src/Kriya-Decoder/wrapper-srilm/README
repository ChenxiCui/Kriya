                            -- Python Wrapper for SRILM --

Kriya supports KenLM (Heafield, 2011) for LM integration in the decoder. While a basic version of 
LM integration also supports SRILM (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/), the more 
sophisticated approach that considers the edges in computing a better heuristic is supported only 
for KenLM (see Sankaran et al. 2012 for details). We encourage the user to use KenLM version
that gives a slightly better BLEU score.

As for the Python wrapper for SRILM, we built one using Nitin Madnani's tool. While we modified it 
a bit, we are in the process of verifying if we could distribute it or the .so file as part of Kriya.

In the meanwhile if you prefer to use SRILM instead of KenLM, please download and build it from here:
http://www.desilinguist.org/software/swig-srilm.tar.gz

Set the environment variable NGRAM_SWIG_SRILM to the one having _srilm.so and srilm.py files.
Then comment out/remove the lines 94-98 in Kriya-Decoder/settings.py. Set 'use-srilm=True' in decoder 
config file.
