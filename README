Kriya - A Hierarchical Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation System
==========================================================================

Kriya is an implementation of hierarchical phrase-based (hiero) SMT system. See Chiang, 2007 
for description of Hiero model.

Kriya is entirely implemented in Python and includes both grammar extractor and decoder modules.
Please see the PBML paper for technical details specific to this implementation.

For usage information, see src/README and doc/ directory. The example/ directory includes a toy
Fr-En corpus for training along with a Kriya config file for training Hiero grammar. Please read
example/README for details first.

Required Software:
------------------
The following is a list of software that might be required depending on what you are trying to do.

* Python  - 2.6.2 or later (but not Python 3.0+)

* Giza++  - For word alignments
* MOSES   - for extracting phrase alignments from Giza++ output and (optionally) for MERT
* SRILM   - For building language model (LM)
* KenLM   - Library for querying the language model (a Python wrapper is included with the decoder
            and the source for the wrapper will be released soon)
* MegaM   - Mega model optimization package (download from: http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hal/megam/)
* SVMRank - SVM for Ranking optimization (download from: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm_light/svm_rank.html)

At least one of the last two optimization tools are required for Kriya parameter optimization with PRO.
